Project Proposal : Atheism Detecting Application 

Abstract:

Atheism, or disbelieve in the existence of Allah, God, the creator, is rising worldwide. A serious dislike towards Islam, or Islamophobia is rising not only in non-Islamic countries, but also in Muslim countries.
Atheists and agnostics scored lower on measures of happiness, positive affect, and self-esteem compared to religious group members. They were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. As their family member or well-wishers don’t want their loving one as an atheist .
purpose of the project is help the family member to know their children’s inner feeling and views.

1.1 Introduction 
We build research hypothesis through this application and after completing all the steps we can get a hypothetical result and our main goal is to keep people spiritually fit . This project follows a Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) . 

1.2 Scope or objective of the project
Create Some Poll, Multiple-Choice Question , Puzzle , Mind Game on this application (App) . 
These will be an object and verifiable observation or piece of information that can be confirmed through empirical evidence or other reliable sources or survey ( a quantitative research method that involves collecting information from a group of people by asking them questions and analyzing the results).

2.Overview

Authority(Researcher) can add different questions , modules   and manage them.
Design of this project is so simple that the user won’t find difficulties while working on it. This project is easy to operate and understood by the end  users .
In addition, the system need MySQL/Oracle/SQL as data storage and Database Management System.




3.Proposed Methodology :

The Waterfall methodology — also known as the Waterfall model — is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins. 

3.1 Requirement Analysis :

In the Waterfall model, requirement analysis is a crucial phase that sets the foundation for the entire software development process. The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one. Here are the key steps involved in requirement analysis within the Waterfall model:

System Requirements Specification:
 Clearly define the purpose and scope of the software project.
Gather initial requirements   from stakeholders, researchers  relevant parties.
Clearly document the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
Besides it totally depend on assumption, probability, research fact on so on . So , on initial phase we have to clear this matter to the authority. Identify any constraints or limitations that may impact the development process
 Detail and document the functional and non-functional requirements in a comprehensive manner.

 Detail and document the functional and non-functional requirements in a comprehensive manner.


 Architectural Design:
Design the overall system architecture, considering factors like scalability and maintainability. Define the components of the app, polls , questions , puzzles,   such as the input processing module, atheism detection algorithm, and result presentation module.

Data Flow Diagram:
Create a data flow diagram to illustrate the flow of information within the app.Identify data sources from end user (atheist), processing steps, and output destinations(Database) .

Interface Design:
Design the user interface, considering usability and accessibility.
Specify how users will interact with the app, inputting data and receiving results. But ,  we have to take special care that the user should not know about our goal , if he/she  if he /she could understand then she could mislead us.

3.3 Implementation and Unit Testing 

The technology used in this research are: 1) Windows 10 Operating System. 2) MySQL Database Server. 3) Framework 4) Jframe. 5)Database. Applications in this paper is web-based application where all software support is open source.

Coding:
•	Developers write code based on the detailed design specifications.
•	Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation.

Unit Testing:
•	Developers write and execute unit tests for each module or component in isolation.
•	The goal is to ensure that each unit of the software performs as intended and that it functions correctly in isolation. 






3.4 Integration and system Testing 


After unit testing, integration testing is performed to ensure that the individual components work together as a complete system. It involves testing the interactions between components. Once integration testing is successful, system testing is carried out to validate the entire system against the specified requirements.

3.5 Acceptance Testing:

The final phase of the Waterfall model is acceptance testing, where the software is tested to ensure that it meets the customer's expectations and requirements.

3.6 Maintenance Phase

 In this final stage, maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in earlier stages of the cycle life. Maintenance in this research are fixing the bugs and perform data backups on a regular basis.

4 Result and Discussion : 


In the implementation phase of the Waterfall model, we successfully developed an Atheism Detection Algorithm based on the defined requirements. The algorithm is designed to analyze both text and speech inputs to identify potential expressions or indicators of atheism. The design phase focused on creating a user-friendly interface for the Atheism Detection App.
During the development process, careful attention was given to ethical considerations related to atheism detection. The team engaged in discussions and assessments to minimize biases and avoid potential ethical dilemmas associated with the nature of the content being analyzed.

5 Conclution :

Continuous refinement of the algorithm and user interface will be pursued to enhance overall performance and researcher  satisfaction. This is a general template and should be adapted based on the specific details of your atheism project, including the project's goals, methodologies, and unique findings.
